# ComparAB
Compare file A to file B and remove common lines from file B.

Example you have in file A:
test01
test02
test03

In file B:
test02
test03
test04
test05
test06

By first selecting file A then B you will get a file B as follows:
test04
test05
test06

The common lines being "test01", "test02" and "test 03", they were removed from file B. File A remains unchanged.
